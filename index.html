    Fruits and vegetables form the base of everybody’s daily food consumption. However, not everyone has access to fresh
    and healthy vegetables and fruits due to various reasons. Starting from farming methods that involve toxicants to
    storage systems and logistics, many sellers land up with rotten raw foods or foods exposed to chemicals and other
    radicals. Bigbasket has now turned the scene around with its online shopping store, where you can have fresh potato,
    tomato, carrots, onions and everything else on your grocery list, delivered to your doorstep, even without stepping
    out of your house. Apart from your regular local produce, you can also shop for other seasonal produces such as
    asparagus, broccoli, drumstick, white onion and more on bigbasket’s online store. Packaging plays a vital role in up
    keeping the freshness of your fruits and vegetables. Green leafy vegetables are prone to spoilage easily if not
    handled properly. While ordering online in bigbasket, worries about packaging and hygiene can be kept at bay. Be it
    your lettuce, cauliflower or any green vegetable, the packaging standard is specific and of high quality. You can
    find a whole wide range of vegetables such as red cabbage, drumstick leaves and different exotic ones as well on
    bigbasket. Apart from quality, we also believe in making fresh foods available to all and thus, you can find very
